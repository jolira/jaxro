JAXRO
=====

JAXB is very powerful, but does not work easily with legacy application. This is a solution that allows enterprise users to add JAXB type annotations to existing applications and externalize them using XML and JSON.

This solution is in production at a very, very large retailer and has been performing very well for more than a year.
